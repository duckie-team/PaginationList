# PaginationList

Custom LazyList with Pagination added to Jetpack Compose LazyList.

---

## Why?

The existing Paging3 library is cumbersome to use, and integration with Jetpack Compose is not smooth. Therefore, we made a LazyList that simply includes Pagination.

## API Design

```kotlin
PaginationList()
```

# TODO

## License

```
will be MIT
```

## Happy Coding :)
