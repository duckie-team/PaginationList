# PaginationList

Custom LazyList with Pagination added to Jetpack Compose LazyList.

---

## Why?

The existing Paging3 library is cumbersome to use, and integration with Jetpack Compose is not smooth. Therefore, we made a LazyList that simply includes Pagination.

## API Design

```kotlin
PaginationList()
```

### Support

1. PagingSource
2. insertSeparators
3. header/footer

# TODO

## License

## Happy Coding :)
